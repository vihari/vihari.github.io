<span style="background-color:yellow">I plan to finish my PhD soon and I am looking for job opportunities! Please feel free to ping me if you have any offer that suits me ðŸ˜€</span><br>

I am a PhD student with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science department</a> at IIT Bombay advised by <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/">Prof. Sunita Sarawagi</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/">Prof. Soumen Chakrabarty</a>. I work in the area of Applied Machine Learning with emphasis on problems arising due to domain shifts.  
My PhD is funded by Google PhD Fellowship. 

</br>
Before joining IIT Bombay, I had spent two wonderful years as a research member staff at <a herf="https://amuselabs.com/">Amuse Labs</a> contributing features to a digital archival project called <a href="https://epadd.stanford.edu/">ePADD</a>. 
I graduated with computer science majors from <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in/">IIT Mandi</a> and that is where I found my love for trekking.

An overview of my research and background can be found in <a href="/publications">Publications</a> and <a href="/assets/vihari.pdf">CV</a> respectively. You can reach me using any of the contact pointers provided in the footer.
