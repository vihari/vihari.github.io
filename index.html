<!--<span style="background-color:yellow">I am actively looking for a postdoc position. Please feel free to ping me if you know of any such opportunity ðŸ˜€ <a href='assets/Vihari_RS.pdf'>[Research Statement]</a></span><br>-->

I am a postdoc with the <a href="https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/">Machine Learning Group</a> of Cambridge University, supervised by <a href="mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/">Dr Adrian Weller</a>. From 2017-2022, I was a PhD student with the <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science department</a> of IIT Bombay 
advised by two amazing researchers: <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/">Prof. Sunita Sarawagi</a> and 
<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/">Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti</a>. My PhD was supported by Google PhD Fellowship. 

I am passionate about research challenges that arise when deploying Machine Learning systems in the wild. Currently, my research focus in on discovering alternative forms of human-to-machine and machine-to-human communication that engender more trust and control over ML models.

Before joining IIT Bombay, I had spent two wonderful years as a research member staff at <a herf="https://amuselabs.com/">Amuse Labs</a> contributing features to a digital archival project called <a href="https://epadd.stanford.edu/">ePADD</a>. 
I graduated with computer science majors from <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in/">IIT Mandi</a> and that is where I found my love for trekking.
