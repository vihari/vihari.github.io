I am a final year PhD student with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science department</a> at IIT Bombay 
advised by <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/">Prof. Sunita Sarawagi</a> and 
<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/">Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti</a>. 
I am passionate about research challenges that arise when deploying Machine Learning systems in the wild.  
My PhD is supported by Google PhD Fellowship. 

<p>
Before joining IIT Bombay, I had spent two wonderful years as a research member staff at <a herf="https://amuselabs.com/">Amuse Labs</a> contributing features to a digital archival project called <a href="https://epadd.stanford.edu/">ePADD</a>. 
I graduated with computer science majors from <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in/">IIT Mandi</a> and that is where I found my love for trekking.
