**TL;DR**. I had applied to be a grad student with some of the top schools in the US four times between 2013-2018, and did not make it.
I refused to enroll as a PhD student in India because I was not well-informed, but I finally did in 2019 and it worked out really well.
The intent of this document is to better inform the new generation of prospective PhDs about higher studies in India.

# Perks

I had a terrific PhD experience at IIT Bombay, reasons below. The following are also what I think I would have missed had I gone to the US. 


<a id="org3a543f3"></a>

## PhD supervision

If you haven't already noticed, the PhD pool in India (at least in Computer Science) is very small. Number of strong PhDs is even smaller.
What this means is awesome Supervisor-PhD ratio. I used to meet with my supervisors very often. They were just a door-knock away (leaving aside the crazy COVID times).
I had the pleasure of learning directly from the masters of the art both about life and science. My decision to enroll as a PhD student in 2019 was mostly influenced by this.
Where else would a PhD get such attention from well-accomplished researchers?


<a id="org23793a4"></a>

## Self-paced research.

The stress to publish is relatively low. The pace of research is determined by the student most of the time.
An advisor usually will not be breathing down your neck to publish because a PhD is not paid from their grants unlike in the US. PhDs are paid by MHRD (i.e. Indian government) directly.


<a id="org32a4257"></a>

## Resume.

If you're one of those who fear PhD from India may not look so strongly on your profile like the way I was, there are some workarounds.
During my PhD, I was awarded the Google PhD fellowship, Prime Minister's fellowship for Doctoral Research, best thesis awards, and published in top-tier venues.
I believe it is easier to stand-out among a relatively small pool of PhD students in India and compensate for any affiliation-related weakness in your profile.


<a id="org3bae976"></a>

## See and tell.

Unlike overseas PhD labs, one can easily visit, work, interact and explore what it is like joining a lab in India.
I spent almost an year at IITB before deciding to join as a student; such a well informed choice is unlikely to go south.
I have seen instances where Indian students in the US finding it hard because they do not like the research environment or because they are unable to find a suitable advisor.


<a id="org0cd347b"></a>

## Matters of money, culture and climate.

This is somewhat self-explanatory.
I did not have to face any issues due to climate or cultural shift or stress about financial matters so much (that is assuming you're fine with around 35,000 Rs stipend) during PhD.
I had a wonderful time camping in the Sahyadri hills, eating good food (IITB canteens are the best I have seen), volunteering at Isha yoga events, celebrating every festival grandly, and never had to endure extreme weather.
I was close to my family, friends and community, which helped me sail through my PhD without hurting my sanity.
Needless to say, I didn't have to worry about a VISA expiring or a mounting debt. 


<a id="orga8e19fd"></a>

## Ease of admission.

If you have a bachelors from one of the IITs like me, it is easy to enroll again into an IIT for a PhD.


<a id="orgbd92f4b"></a>

## Grounded perspective.

Campuses in India (like that of IITB) are secluded from the outside world. But once we step outside, the scale and intensity of Indian societal problems (mostly pertaining standard of living) are right on face.
The complex, chaotic, messy Mumbai always humbled me and kept me grounded, and reminded me of the real complex problems that are far fetched from mainstream AI research.
People of Mumbai, on the other hand, taught me to keep the spirits high even amidst all the troubles. 


<a id="orgd62b2c3"></a>

## Housing, Security, Food and Medical.

Many decent Indian colleges provide a cocoon-like self-sufficient campus.
Accommodation, security and medical cover are provided for every student.
Moreover, quality food is catered at an unbelievably low subsidized price inside the campus.  
Needless to say, these facilities are in strong contrast to most other places overseas.
The jubilant night life, compassionate hostel-mates, devil-may-care campus, night views across the Powai lake, and the sense of belonging kept me going during PhD. 


<a id="org1002e30"></a>

## Small community.

Researchers in India tend to know each other well. So, I found it easier to get good internships or could just shoot a mail to any researcher in India and get response.


<a id="org2ca3812"></a>

# Drawbacks

You may have to watch out and proactively make up for the following drawbacks.


<a id="orgd4893c5"></a>

## Communication & Presentation skills.

A researcher's success hugely depends on how well they communicate. For various reasons, the PhD programs in India are not structured to test, push and hone the technical presentation skills of their students (at IITs and IISc as far as I know).
The student must exercise special care to push themselves to attend, present, and seek feedback.
Several universities overseas have facilities to help students with their writing and presentations such as through one-on-one sessions with language professionals. 


<a id="org34c10be"></a>

## Strong Conviction.

Owing to the self-paced attitude towards research, a PhD student in India must have strong conviction towards their research.
Your PhD cohort need not be as passionate thereby requiring special effort not to regress to the average.


<a id="orgd91c00d"></a>

## Networking

I feel Indian academic organizations are not structured for serendipity.
It is not easy to stumble into a researcher or faculty from other departments or even from the same department.
Over all the years at IITB, I only ever met with very few.
Unfortunately, there is no easy work-around for this. 


<a id="org02e3ca0"></a>

## Clear Future Goals.

Some career choices such as wanting to become a professor in the US or UK are eliminated or are made hard by a PhD from India.
Having clear, albeit rough, career goals can help in this regard. Look closely at where all the alumni made it to. 


<a id="org0b72e12"></a>

# Conclusion

I have hopefully communicated what one can achieve by staying back. I am not advocating in anyway (for any moral, ethical or otherwise reason) to pursue a PhD in India. 
But before you sign-up for a seemingly mediocre PhD position in the US, please consider very carefully if you would do better by staying back.
This dialogue from Shahrukh Khan from Dear Zindagi aptly puts it.

> Kabhi kabhi hum mushkil rasta sirf is liye chunte hai, kyun ki humein lagta hai, important cheezein paane ke liye humein mushkil rasta apnana chahiye. Apne aap ko punish karna bahut zaroori samajhte hai. But why? Aasaan rasta kyun nahi chun sakte? Kya burai hai us mein? Khaas karke jab us mushkil ka saamna karne ke liye hum taiyaar hi nahi hai!

Translation: <https://www.filmyquotes.com/movies/1663>

> Sometimes we choose a difficult path only because &#x2026; we feel that to attain important things we need to choose a difficult path &#x2026; we think that it's important to punish ourselves &#x2026; but why can't we choose a simple path &#x2026; what's wrong with that &#x2026; especially when we are not ready to face that difficult path

**Limitations of this note**.   

-   Many of the above stated pros do not apply or do not matter if you chose a wrong supervisor. Research well about the person before signing up.
-   Things are different in Sciences. I have written from the perspective of a Computer Science PhD student. I believe research facilities in sciences matter a lot, and not so much in our field. If you are a Prospective Science PhD, please take these with a pinch of salt.
